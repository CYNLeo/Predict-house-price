# Predict-house-price (School assignment)
Predict house prices with different algorithms

Objective: Predict the price of a house based on various features such as area, number of
bedrooms, location, etc.

Algorithms: Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, and Linear Regression

Instructions:
1. Train different models using different algorithms.
2. Evaluate the models on the test set using performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error,
R-Squared, etc.
3. Compare the performance of different algorithms and select the best model.
4. Output the prediction using the best model.
